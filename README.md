 <h2></h2>
<p>MusicBook is an app that prides itself on being a no-frills, one-stop shop for collaborating on music! It incorporates a Postgres relational databse to house all user inputed data supported by a ruby on rails scripting language/web framework to round out the backend of the project. The app was developed by Jacon Condes and Christopher Cook while wrapping up their tenure at GA.  </p>

<h2>Technologies Implemented</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Approach</h2>
<hr>
<p>During the wireframing phase both memebers unanimously agreed on a non-cluttered and bias-free landing page that lets the user enjoy the point of the site, music! Individual tasks were assigned via a Trello board for tracking sprints in addition to  handwritten and digital formats to design object models and outline site information.  </p>
